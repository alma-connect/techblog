This article is about implementing a simple publisher/subscriber model in Rails using [ActiveSupport::Notifications (ASN)](http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveSupport/Notifications.html). Exploring problem areas where PUBSUB can improve modularity and reduce coupling. We would also upgrade our basic implementation to cater to common use cases.

# <a name="about-pub-sub">A little about PUB/SUB?</a>

According to [wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publish%E2%80%93subscribe_pattern) is: 

> In software architecture, publishâ€“subscribe is a messaging pattern where senders of messages, called publishers, do not program the messages to be sent directly to specific receivers, called subscribers. Instead, published messages are characterized into classes, without knowledge of what, if any, subscribers there may be. Similarly, subscribers express interest in one or more classes, and only receive messages that are of interest, without knowledge of what, if any, publishers there are.

Rails is a good framework for proof-of-concept and small applications, it promotes conventions over configuration. As the application grows it becomes difficult to maintain. This is primarily because rails promotes coupeled architecture with fat model, skinny controller approach. Developers need to adopt to new patterns and create new conventions to keep projects moving on pace and in shape. PUBSUB can help us resolve some of the problems we face often.

# <a name="basic-implementation">Implementing basic publisher & subscriber; lets get it on</a>

Basic requirements of our PUBSUB are:

  1. Publishers should be able to publish named events with payload
  2. Subscribers should be able to subscribe to events matching a name and should receive the payload object with every event

Such a system is already bundled with rails: its ASN. ASN is used through out rails internally for instrumentation. The basic implementation of ASN is such a simple yet powerful API that we can start our PUBSUB implementation on top of it.

## <a name="basic-publisher">Publisher</a>

{% highlight ruby linenos %}
# app/pub_sub/publisher.rb
module Publisher
  extend self
 
  # delegate to ActiveSupport::Notifications.instrument
  def broadcast_event(event_name, payload={})
    if block_given?
      ActiveSupport::Notifications.instrument(event_name, payload) do
        yield
      end
    else
      ActiveSupport::Notifications.instrument(event_name, payload)
    end
  end
end
{% endhighlight %}

This is as simple as it gets. Publisher can broadcast an event with a payload. An optional block can be passed. If a block is passed, event published will also contain information about execution time and exception if any. All additional goodness associated with blocks is provided by ASN used as underlying implementation, interesting!!).

{% highlight ruby linenos %}
if user.save
  # publish event 'user.created', with payload {user: user}
  Publisher.broadcast_event('user.created', user: user)
end

def create_user(params)
  user = User.new(params)
  
  # publish event 'user.created', with payload {user: user}, using block syntax 
  # now the event will have additional data about duration and exceptions
  Publisher.broadcast_event('user.created', user: user) do 
    User.save!
    # do some more important stuff here
  end
end
{% endhighlight %}


## <a name="basic-subscriber">Subscriber</a>

{% highlight ruby linenos %}
# app/pub_sub/subscriber.rb
module Subscriber
  # delegate to ActiveSupport::Notifications.subscribe
  def self.subscribe(event_name)
    if block_given?
      ActiveSupport::Notifications.subscribe(event_name) do |*args|
        event = ActiveSupport::Notifications::Event.new(*args)
        yield(event)
      end
    end
  end
end
{% endhighlight %}

Subscriber can be used to subscribe to a named event and passed block will receive an instance of [ActiveSupport::Notifications::Event](http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveSupport/Notifications/Event.html) as parameter.

{% highlight ruby linenos %}
# subscriber example usage
Subscriber.subscribe('user.created') do |event|
  error = "Error: #{event.payload[:exception].first}" if event.payload[:exception]
  puts "#{event.transaction_id} | #{event.name} | #{event.time} | #{event.duration} | #{event.payload[:user].id} | #{error}"
end
{% endhighlight %}


# <a name="use-cases">Use cases where PUB/SUB can be helpful</a>

These are some problems we face in our routine work, which can be solved by PUBSUB:

  - [Mail deliveries coupled with code](#problem-mail-delivery-coupling)
  - [Messy callback chain introduced due to denormalization](#problem-callbacks-in-denormalized-models)
  - [Handling of events like user milestone reached, batchmate signed up](#problem-handling-special-events)

## <a name="problem-mail-delivery-coupling">Mail deliveries coupled with code</a>

**Problem:** There are always some kind of notifications at work in any user centric application. Generally it starts with `after_save` model callback and slowly moves out of there to a services layer. Lets explore, how can we handle welcome emails using PUBSUB.

**Solution:** Since we are adding this pattern to our application, lets bake in the modularity in core usage, for the time being a simple string namespace should be good enough.

{% highlight ruby linenos %}
# app/pub_sub/publisher.rb
module Publisher
  extend ::ActiveSupport::Concern
  extend self

  included do
    # add support for namespace, one class - one namespace
    class_attribute :pub_sub_namespace

    self.pub_sub_namespace = nil
  end

  # delegate to class method
  def broadcast_event(event_name, payload={})
    if block_given?
      self.class.broadcast_event(event_name, payload) do
        yield
      end
    else
      self.class.broadcast_event(event_name, payload)
    end
  end


  module ClassMethods
    # delegate to ASN
    def broadcast_event(event_name, payload={})
      event_name = [pub_sub_namespace, event_name].compact.join('.')
      if block_given?
        ActiveSupport::Notifications.instrument(event_name, payload) do
          yield
        end
      else
        ActiveSupport::Notifications.instrument(event_name, payload)
      end
    end
  end

end
{% endhighlight %}

The publisher under went some changes. It can be included in a class and after setting a namespace, you are all set to publish events in that namespace. Lets start broadcasting event `user_signed_up` in `registration` namespace.

{% highlight ruby linenos %}
# app/pub_sub/publishers/registration.rb
module Publishers
  class Registration
    include Publisher

    self.pub_sub_namespace = 'registration'
  end
end

# broadcast event
if user.save
  Publishers::Registration.broadcast_event('user_signed_up', user: user)
end
{% endhighlight %}

Publisher seems to be good, lets add some ruby goodness to subscribers too.

{% highlight ruby linenos %}
# app/pub_sub/subscribers/base.rb
module Subscribers
  class Base
    class_attribute :subscriptions_enabled
    attr_reader :namespace

    def initialize(namespace)
      @namespace = namespace
    end

    # attach public methods of subscriber with events in the namespace
    def self.attach_to(namespace)
      log_subscriber = new(namespace)
      log_subscriber.public_methods(false).each do |event|
        ActiveSupport::Notifications.subscribe("#{namespace}.#{event}", log_subscriber)
      end
    end

    # trigger methods when an even is captured
    def call(message, *args)
      method  = message.gsub("#{namespace}.", '')
      handler = self.class.new(namespace)
      handler.send(method, ActiveSupport::Notifications::Event.new(message, *args))
    end
  end
end
{% endhighlight %}

We have created a base class which subscribers can extend. Base class contains the magic to map events in a namespace to methods in the subscriber. Lets subscribe to the event we have been broadcasting and send the welcome email.

{% highlight ruby linenos %}
# app/pub_sub/subscribers/registration_mailer.rb
module Subscribers
  class RegistrationMailer < ::Subscribers::Base
    def user_signed_up(event)
      # lets delay the delivery using delayed_job
      RegistrationMailer.delay(priority: 1).welcome_email(event.payload[:user])
    end
  end
end

# config/initializers/subscribers.rb
Subscribers::RegistrationMailer.attach_to('registration')
{% endhighlight %}

This looks good, signup process just broadcasts an event about user signup and carries on with its tasks. Modules which are not core to the application can then hook onto these events to attach extended functionality. 

Building modular, loosely coupled system with message publishing has its own cons. Biggest being, the system is too loosely coupled. If something stops working no errors start cropping up and it might take too long to identify it. However I believe that failures can happen anywhere and a system which fails with grace is more robust that one which fails completely. Its another layer which gets introduced while building scalable systems. **Base Line:** for me pros out weigh the cons

**Conclusion:** With little modifications, our PUBSUB now supports namespaces (read features, modules, sub-systems, opportunities!!). Adding a layer on top of already useful `ActiveSupport::Notification` already feels good enough.


## <a name="problem-callbacks-in-denormalized-models">Messy callback chain introduced due to denormalization</a>

**Problem:** We use mongodb via mongoid and denormalize data to cut down on queries. Initially it was some callbacks and method overrides, which grew out to be modules and then a simple re-usable denormalization plugin. Plugin fall backs to querying data from related model and also cache it for future use. This works like a cache fetch, calculate, store strategy with remote document as origin and current document as cache store. The code looks something like:

{% highlight ruby linenos %}
# app/models/user.rb
class User
  include AlmaConnect::Denormalization
  field :name, type: String
  has_many :posts

  # this sets up a callback for when name changes,
  # it propagates changes to posts where user_id matches the user
  denormalize_to :posts, fields: [:name]
end

# app/models/post.rb
class Post
  include AlmaConnect::Denormalization
  belongs_to :user

  # this sets up a callback to update user_name when user_id changes
  # also fetch and set, user name from user if it is not already set, when accessed
  denormalize_from :user, fields: [:name]
end
{% endhighlight %}

It has been working out very nicely, but it results in very coupled code. We define denormalization macros in the models. This makes all our models aware of what data they are denormalizing, where from and also what data they need to denormalize, where to. What if we need to denormalize user name to comment as well?

{% highlight ruby linenos %}
# app/models/comment.rb
class Comment
  include AlmaConnect::Denormalization
  embedded_in :post
  belongs_to :user, inverse_of: nil
  denormalize_from :user, fields: [:name]
end

# app/models/post.rb
class Post
  include AlmaConnect::Denormalization
  belongs_to :user
  embeds_many :comments
  denormalize_from :user, fields: [:name]
end

# app/models/user.rb
class User
  include AlmaConnect::Denormalization
  field :name, type: String
  has_many :posts
  denormalize_to :posts, fields: [:name]

  # we don't define the relation here, still define the denormalization macro
  denormalize_to 'post.comments', fields: [:name]

  # may be many more denormalize_to calls here if comment has a polymorphic parent
end
{% endhighlight %}

You see the problem, right? User need not have knowledge about comment, but needed it there to sync changes whenever user name changes.

**Solution:** Instead of sprinkling denormalization macros all around, we can leave the from macros as is, the fallback logic is very handy. We can replace to macros, with publishing change events. We would simply publish a message whenever a user name changes. We would capture the change in a `before_save` callback and publish it in `after_save`. By publishing in `after_save` we ensure that user is persisted at time of publishing. We can change the publisher to hook directly into model callback chain. Lets call the change events: notifications, because they are not wrappers around code blocks. They are simply notifications that "something changed". Events can be described as: "something happened and it took this much time to do it, oh sorry! it was just attempted, we got this error and it was not completed."

Lets create a publisher module, which can be included in any active model complaint model, supporting callbacks. Model can attach a namespace to itself and assign a publisher to the namespace. Attached publisher should immediately start broadcasting important notifications like created and destroyed. To broadcast additional notifications, publisher should be able to hook in.

{% highlight ruby linenos %}
# app/pub_sub/publishers/base.rb
# hook into model callback chain when a publisher is attached to a model 
# capture changes before_save and publish in after_save
# start publishing created and destroyed notification
module Publishers
  module Base
    extend ActiveSupport::Concern

    # inject a reader to handle notifications for model in namespaces
    def pub_sub_notifications
      @pub_sub_notifications ||= ::Publishers::PubSubNotifications.new(self)
    end

    module ClassMethods
      def attach_publisher(namespace, publisher_class)
        # attach publisher to model class
        after_initialize do |model|
          model.pub_sub_notifications.attach_publisher(namespace, publisher_class)
        end

        # emit created notification and let he publisher hook in to the notifications
        before_save do |model|
          model.pub_sub_notifications.prepare_created(namespace)
          model.pub_sub_notifications.prepare_notifications(namespace)
        end

        # publish notifications after save
        after_save do |model|
          model.pub_sub_notifications.publish_notifications(namespace)
        end

        # emit destroy notification and publish notifications
        after_destroy do |model|
          model.pub_sub_notifications.prepare_destroyed(namespace)
          model.pub_sub_notifications.publish_notifications(namespace)
        end
      end
    end

  end
end

# app/pub_sub/publishers/notifications_queue.rb
# capture attachment of a publisher to a model in a namespace
module Publishers
  class NotificationsQueue
    attr_reader :publisher, :notifications

    def initialize(publisher_name)
      @publisher = publisher_name.to_s.constantize.new
      @notifications = []
    end

    def add_notification(event_name, payload={})
      @notifications << {event_name: event_name, payload: payload}
    end

    def reset_notifications
      @notifications = []
    end
  end
end

# app/pub_sub/publishers/pub_sub_notifications.rb
# handle different attachments of publishers to a model
module Publishers
  class PubSubNotifications
    include ::Publisher

    attr_reader :publishers_info, :model

    def initialize(model)
      @publishers_info = {}
      @model               = model
    end

    def attach_publisher(namespace, publisher_name)
      publishers_info[namespace] ||= Publishers::NotificationsQueue.new(publisher_name)
      true
    end

    def reset_notifications(namespace)
      publishers_info[namespace].reset_notifications
    end

    def add_notification(namespace, event_name, payload={})
      publishers_info[namespace].add_notification(event_name, payload)
    end

    def prepare_created(namespace)
      add_notification(namespace, 'created') if model.new_record?
    end

    def prepare_destroyed(namespace)
      add_notification(namespace, 'destroyed') if model.destroyed?
    end

    def prepare_notifications(namespace)
      publishers_info[namespace].publisher.prepare_notifications(namespace, model)

      return true
    end

    def publish_notifications(namespace)
      publishers_info[namespace].notifications.each do |notification|
        broadcast_event(
            [namespace, notification[:event_name]].compact.join('.'),
            notification[:payload].merge(model: model)
        )
      end

      return true
    end

  end
end
{% endhighlight %}

The code seems a little difficult to follow, bet lets postpone the re-factoring for later. 

Lets try to implement the denormalize_to for user name. Basic flow being: A publisher hooks into user and starts broadcasting created, destroyed and name_changed event. We are only interested in name change here, so we implement a subscriber syncing user name in his posts on name change and ignore the created and destroyed events. We can implement another subscriber to sync changes in comments. In future if we start denormalizing user name to someplace else, we can implement additional subscriber to handle syncing of changes.

{% highlight ruby linenos %}
# app/pub_sub/publishers/user.rb
module Publishers
  module User
    def prepare_notifications(namespace, user)
      if user.name_changed?
        user.pub_sub_notifications.add_notification(namespace, 'name_changed', changes: user.name_changes)
      end
    end
  end
end

# app/models/user.rb
class User
  include Publishers::Base

  attach_publisher('user', Publishers::User)
end

class Subscribers::User::Post < Subscribers::Base
  def name_changed(event)
    Post.where(user_id: event.payload[:model].id).update_all(user_name: event.payload[:changes].last)
  end
end

class Subscribers::User::Comment < Subscribers::Base
  def name_changed(event)
    def name_changed(event)
      iteration_limit = 100 # or fetch max comment count
      posts = Post.all.where(:comments.matches => {user_id: event.payload[:model].id, :user_name.ne => event.payload[:changes].last})
      while iteration_limit > 0 && posts.count > 0
        Post.collection.update(posts.selector, {'$set' => {'comments.$.user_name' => event.payload[:changes].last} }, multi: true, safe: true)
      end
    end
  end
end

# config/initializers/subscribers.rb
Subscribers::User::Post.attach_to('user')
Subscribers::User::Comment.attach_to('user')
{% endhighlight %}

This is a lot more code, but this system seems robust:

  - Easy to add new denormalization points
  - Complete control of how to handle the change
  - A lot more modular system
  - Easily take out some subscriber or publisher without affecting the system
  - Individual sub-components can be enabled, disabled and changed independently

**Conclusion:** Adding some more ruby goodness to the mix, we have built a production grade iron to straighten out the callback spaghetti we have been cooking recently.

## <a name="problem-handling-special-events">Handling of events like user milestone reached, batchmate signed up</a>

**Problem:** A user signs up, this can potentially trigger a user milestone and would most probably trigger batchmate signed up notification. Where do we keep this code? In the service concerned with creation of user? In model callback? Nothing seems to fit the bill.

**Solution:** Lucky for us, we already have our PUBSUB. We can listen to `user.created` event from our user publisher and trigger appropriate behaviour in a subscriber. Sending welcome mail and batchmate activity is not core to the application and should not effect core if SMTP is not working at the moment. In case you didn't notice I secretly switched out the milestone notification with welcome email and left it as an exercise for you. Do share your thoughts on implementation in comments below.

{% highlight ruby linenos %}
# app/services/registration/user_notifications_service.rb

# handles delivery and unbundling of notification
class Registration::UserNotificationsService
  def self.deliver_welcome_email(user)
    RegistrationMailer.welcome(user).deliver
  end

  def self.prepare_batchmate_notification(batchmate)
    User.batchmates_of(batchmate).each do |user|
      Publishers::Registration.broadcast_event('deliver_batchmate_signed_up', batchmate: batchmate, user: user)
    end
  end

  def self.deliver_batchmate_signed_up_email(batchmate, user)
    RegistrationMailer.batchmate_signed_up(user, batchmate).deliver
  end
end
{% endhighlight %}

Notification service has the logic to handle deliveries and unbundling batchmate activity notification to correct recipients. We should probably delay these actions, we do not want to affect the users experience because we need to send him a welcome email or we need to let his batchmates know about his signup. All these things could be done in a background worker.

{% highlight ruby linenos %}
# app/jobs/welcome_email_job.rb
# handled delaying of welcome email
class WelcomeEmailJob
  def initialize(user)
    @user = user
  end

  def perform
    Registration::UserNotificationsService.deliver_welcome_email(user)
  end

  def self.deliver(user)
    Delayed::Job.enqueue(new(user))
  end
end

# app/jobs/batchmate_activity_job.rb
# handled delaying of batchmate activity notification
class BatchmateActivityJob
  def initialize(batchmate, user=nil)
    @batchmate = @batchmate
    @user = user
  end

  def perform
    if bundled?
      Registration::UserNotificationsService.prepare_batchmate_notification(@user, @batchmate)
    else
      Registration::UserNotificationsService.deliver_batchmate_signed_up_email(@user, @batchmate)
    end
  end

  def bundled?
    @user.nil?
  end

  def self.prepare(batchmate)
    Delayed::Job.enqueue(new(batchmate))
  end

  def self.deliver(batchmate, user)
    Delayed::Job.enqueue(new(batchmate, user))
  end
end
{% endhighlight %}

We have wrapped the service methods in two jobs, one handling batchmate notification and one handling welcome email. These jobs present interface similar as the underlying notification service. Lets just implement the subscribers to wire everything up.

{% highlight ruby linenos %}
# app/pub_sub/subscribers/registration/user.rb
class Subscribers::Registration::User < Subscribers::Base
  def created(event)
    WelcomeEmailJob.deliver(user)
    BatchmateActivityJob.prepare(user)
  end
end

module Subscribers
  class RegistrationMailer < ::Subscribers::Base
    def deliver_batchmate_signed_up(event)
      BatchmateActivityJob.deliver(event.payload[:batchmate], event.payload[:user])
    end
  end
end

# config/initializers/subscribers.rb
Subscribers::Registration::User.attach_to('user')
Subscribers::RegistrationMailer.attach_to('registration')
{% endhighlight %}

**Conclusion:** We have built a service which can be consumed as an API in internal project. We have built two jobs wrapping the API to be delayed to background workers. Finally wired everything up using subscribers.

# <a name="concluding-thoughts">Concluding thoughts</a>

A simple pattern like pub/sub can help us write highly decoupled modules. These loosely coupled modules can be composed together in variety of ways to create a flexible, robust and scalable application. These modules can be upgraded without affecting the system if they adhere to a contract of event names and payload data.

# **Update (04 Apr, 2014):**

I will post the queries ann feedback we have received till now. If anybody has something to add, please leave a comment or mail us. Thanks to **Kathy Onu** and **Calinoiu Alexandru Nicolae** for helping with grammar and spellings. **Shaomeng Zhang** I have added a comment to the question.

**Query from Andrey Koleshko:**

I've read you article and I really liked it. In general your approach is awesome. But as I see you provide examples with Rails callbacks.

Ideally in tests we have to prevent the execution of callbacks everywhere except one place - this is place where we want to test only publishers' triggers. But as I know Rails doesn't provide some adequate facility to turn on/off callbacks. Any advises to solve the problem?

**Reply:**

Frankly speaking, our code base is very much untested and test suite is as good as no tests at all, so I would not be able suggest anything concrete in this area. We had the current implementation in place for a few weeks before the article, but it was for very specific use cases. As we realized the potential applications of PUB/SUB in rails, I got excited and wrote an article to get some feedback from the community. It is working great for us, but in no way it is the final stable structure.

I am not sure how to enable/disable callbacks for rails. However, for publishers if you implement the publisher as a base class instead of module (similar to subscriber in [Mail Delivery Coupling](#problem-mail-delivery-coupling)), you should be able to implement a class attribute for enabling/disabling individual or all publishers.

**Query from Seif:**

Thanks for sharing this awesome post. I just have one question. Does it work in the same session or on a different thread. For example, if the subscription method take 10 seconds to complete, will it affect response time?

**Reply:**

Yes this will work synchronously. If a subscription takes 10 secs to complete, it will affect the response time for the request. However, you can initiate a background task in subscriber instead of actually doing work. Queue for ASN can also be changed. You can look into different options(redis is first thing that comes to my mind) or implement a ASN compatible queue yourself to get the desired behavior.

**Followup from Seif:**

Thanks for the response. About background jobs, Iâ€™m using Sidekiq, but its kinda tedious to create a worker for every listener. Any recommended pub-sub that supports threading?

**Reply:**

My suggestion would be create the workers, modular code is always good in long run. If you are using sidekiq you already have redis in your tech stack. You can implement a subscriber to listen to any event which should be backgrounded and put it in a redis queue. You can have other process(redis listener) to pop events from redis and trigger them in threads. Additional subscribers can be created to handle backgrounded events and can be attached in the redis listener.
